This website was built during my sixth week in my coding course. It was my first full CRUD website. The requirements for the assignment were to make a website in which a user can create, read, update, and destroy an item. 

[Go to alpacaPost](https://alpacapost.herokuapp.com/alpacapost)

### Technologies Used:
* Node.js
* Mongoose
* Express
* EJS
* Express Session
* BCrypt
* Bootstrap

As someone who loves to travel, I thought it would be fun to make a website for sending postcards. I relish the tangibility and love that goes into a real postcard, however I have found that regular mail can be quite slow, especially when sending from a foreign country. On my website called alpacaPost, users can choose from an index of pre-loaded postcards that they can add a message to or they can upload their own photo to send.

### User Stories:
* Users can register and login with encrypted password.
* Users can create a postcard.
* Users can view a postcard.
* Users can edit a postcard.
* Users can delete a postcard.

There's very few animals I would trust to deliver mail for me and the alpaca is one of them. I chose the name alpacaPost because I am ever so impressed with an alpaca's ability to travel over various types of terrain in such an efficient manner. Not to mention they are, in my humble opinion, one of the cutest and spunkiest of the mammals. With my first opportunity in designing a brand, I used one of my own hand drawn images in creating the logo.

As far as styling goes, I wanted this website to have a fun, but minimalistic and clean look to it. I wanted the images to be the focal point for the user. After all, sharing an experience using an image and a quaintly paired story about the image is engraved in the age old tradition of sending postcards. I used Bootstrap as a framework for the layout of alpacaPost and used ejs partials in order to achieve DRY code and a consistent look throughout the website.

There are some aspects of alpacaPost that I will continue to work on. I would like to give the user the option of sending messages to other users as well as by email. It would be optimal for the user to be able to click on the postcard to flip it over and view the message on the back(EDIT: this has been achieved using CSS animation). 

 I think my favorite part of programming is looking at the progress I make each week. I am strengthened by every challenge I encounter and am hooked by the satisfaction I gain when I overcome these challenges.
